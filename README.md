# TacoShack2.0
This is a bot for the tacoshack bot (Proceed with caution as it might get you banned). This was made for fun as a coding challange. I don't know how the TacoShack Discord Bot algorthim works, so it is very possible that you can get banned. So PLEASE DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK

# Intallation
1. First Install the pyautogui module
    Windows: run "py -m pip install pyautogui" into your command prompt (make sure to copy and paste only the stuff inside of the parenthesises
    MacOS or Linus: run "python3 -m pip install pyautogui" into your command prompt (make sure to copy and paste only the stuff inside of the parenthesises

2.  In your IDE (i.e. VSCode), install the python extension as it will help you to turn it

3.  Download this repository and open it up in your IDE and then run it 

# Files Meanings

- TacoShack_Grind: This will run the bot after every 5 minutes with NO INTERPUTIONS (so it is very possible that you may get banned). But it will help with your grind streak and gaining as much money from these commands as possible

- TacoShack_Safe: This will run the bot but not at after every 5 minutes. There are a lot more random pauses, so that it would nimic a real user "trying" to grind. Although you are not getting your grind streak or as much money possible in the time that this command is running, you are less likely to get caught (but remember there is a possibibility that your might get CAUGHT)
